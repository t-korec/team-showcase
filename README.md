This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Task

Create an application that displays data about Teams and their employees.

* Implement using the React library. Feel free to use other libraries or frameworks using React.
* Design an eye-pleasing visual, including a mobile responsive display.
* Way of styling or choosing a library of components of your own choice.
* Show/hide team content
* Employees who no longer work - should be displayed differently
* Display the employee's name and position
* Design and implement the method of adding employees to the team.
* The API is described here: https://github.com/Naomak/alveno-job

Time spent on the project: a couple of hours during the weekend + 3h for the last changes and deploying

Optional tasks(not included in this repo):

* Support for subteams nesting
* Design and implement the addition of teams.
* Design and implement employee editing.

Note: I used this project as an opportunity to learn and try new technologies like nextjs, zod, react-hook-form. Also, this is *not* an accurate representation of what my usual production code looks like. I usually do more iteration and optimize things like data fetching and separating code into more reusable components.  

## Setup

Inside this directory run:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used

* tailwindCSS
* nextjs
* Zod
* react-hook-form
* radix-ui
